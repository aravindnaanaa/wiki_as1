# ReactJS

ReactJS, commonly referred to as React, is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.

## Key Features

React has several key features that make it popular:

- **Component-Based**: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
- **Declarative**: React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.
- **Learn Once, Write Anywhere**: Develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.

## Installation

To install React, you can use the following npm command:

```bash
npm install react
